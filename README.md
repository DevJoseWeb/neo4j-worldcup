World Cup 2014 with Neo4j
==============

## Getting the data

There are 3 steps to getting the data ready for Neo4j:

* Find the pages we want to download e.g. all the matches

````
ruby scripts/find_matches.rb > data/matches.csv
````

* Download those pages

````
# reads from data/matches.csv and downloads into data/matches/
ruby scripts/download_matches.rb
````

* Create CSV files that we can use with Neo4j's LOAD CSV

````
# creates data/import/matches.csv
ruby scripts/to_csv
````

##Â Importing into Neo4j

The [data/import](data/import/) directory contains all the cypher scripts you need to import the data. The scripts contain links to the raw version of CSV files containing the various bits of data.

e.g.

````
/path/to/neo4j/bin/neo4j-shell --file data/import/loadMatches.cyp
````

Or if you want to import all the things you can run the following after updating your Neo4j path:

````
export WC_DB="/Users/markneedham/test-bench/databases/050/neo4j-enterprise-2.1.2"
````

````
./doit.sh
````
